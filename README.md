React Project with Custom Hooks and Reusable Components
This project is a React application built using various libraries such as gh-pages, datetime, moment, and React 18. It includes two custom hooks, one for data fetching and another for form validation. The project also utilizes a popup component called Propup to display clear feedback to the user. The form is divided into separate components to enhance code readability.

Additionally, the project implements a feature where user-uploaded files are converted to base64 format for processing.
